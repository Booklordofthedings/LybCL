## LybCL
A simpleish commandline parsing library with automatic routing functionality

### Installation
Clone the repository and add it to your beef workspace as you usually would.
This libary is also single file, so you may also just copy the file directly into your project if necessary

### Documentation
The .bf sourcefile contains all information neccessary to use the library.
You basically just create a new LybCl object by inserting the args[] and then call function on that object.
The CMDRouter attribute can be used for the automatic routing functionality, however you will need to ensure the type is refelcted.
